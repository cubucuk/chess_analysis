CS210 Project: Chess.com Games Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for my data analysis project, where I analyzed my chess games played on Chess.com. The project aims to gain insights into my gameplay, opponents, and performance. 
The data is collected by downloading all the games from my chess.com profile with the username 'emrecubukcu'. The sample size is 637 games and spans roughly 3 years of games. 

Data:

The sample data used in the project is downloaded in a pgn file, which then I parsed in my ipynb file python code into an organized dataframe. 
The pgn file contains my username, oponent username, result, my elo, oponent elo, date, termination of the game (the fashion in which the game ended: by mate, by resignation, by time running out etc.) and moves of the game.

Results and Findings: 

From the data analysis, we can see that I have a win rate of about 55%, draw rate of 4% and loss rate of 41%. I won 59% of my games where I played white and 51% of my games where I played black, which is to be expected.
Advanced analysis of results and findings can be reached from the 'report' in the repository.
